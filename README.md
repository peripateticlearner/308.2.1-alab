## Introduction
This assignment involves developing a program that generates recommendations based on input data and several conditions. As you expand your programming skills, solving logic problems like this will become second nature, and your code will be more efficient.

---

## Objectives
- Implement control flow using conditionals and control flow keywords.
- Create a program that executes based on conditional logic.

---

## Setup Instructions
1. Initialize a new Git repository in a local project folder.
2. Create a JavaScript file to contain your code.
3. Commit frequently! Every time something works, commit it. Use version control to roll back changes if needed.

## Part 1: Growing Pains
Develop a program that helps environmental scientists manage plant growth in a contained area.

### Key Information
- The garden is **circular**, with a **radius of 5 meters**.
- Use the formula to calculate the area of the garden:
  ```javascript
  const PI = 3.1415;
  const area = PI * radius * radius;
